## Purpose

The purpose of this repository was to have fun building a simple game engine on the browser and to try out creation of a monorepo containing an NPM package and a Svelte application.

## Description

During my studies at Queen's University I took a Game Development course taught by Nicholas Graham. In this course we looked at a simple game engine developed using Java and Java AWT. I was intrigued by this and being a web developer decided to create one for the web. I used Typescript and browser APIs and this is the result. TS Engine is a very simple engine supporting only text and rectangular shapes. It is by no means robust or complete but has been enjoyable to create.

This repository contains the NPM package TS Engine containing the simple game engine as well as a Svelte app that showcases a game made using the engine.

## Tech Stack

-  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
-  [HTML Canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp)
-  [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/docs)

## Possible Improvements

Given that this is a game engine there is an infinite amount of features that could be added. I am sure there are performance issues to be resolved as well as more obvious problems such as the capability to have a consistent framerate. The most relavent features that could be added in my perspective at this time would be the ability to render more than just rectangles to the game, circular shapes or sprites would be a great addition.
